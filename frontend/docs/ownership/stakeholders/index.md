# Ultri Co-op Stakeholders

There are two stakeholder groups, the developers and the end users.

* Developers contribute their work, for a larger part of the profits.
* Software end users pay a monthly fee for access to the Saas offerings, they get a larger say in the direction of the product.

## Non-Owner Stakeholders

We have co-op, sociocracy and open source projects we work with informally.
