## Workspace Directory and Permissions

Your data never leaves your computer, so we need a place to store it. The Chrome Filesystem API allows storing the data in a directory of your choosing.

* You **must** grant the browser permssion for the app to work.
* We will create a `ULTRI-WORKSPACE.json` in the root of the directory.
* We create a `ultri-workspace` subdirectory for the data files.
* You may grant the app access to other directories, outside of the main workspace.
