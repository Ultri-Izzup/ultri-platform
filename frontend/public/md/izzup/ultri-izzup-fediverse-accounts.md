## Ultri - Izzup Fediverse Accounts - COMING SOON!!

Each membership in the Ultri Collective is allowed to create multiple business and personal Fediverse accounts.

The accounts are either `@ultri.com` or `@izzup.com`.

* Izzup is a social with as few barriers as possible, we try to be open with who we connect with.
* Ultri.com provides a more professional environment, is only federated with a handful of sites, one of them being Izzup.com.
* We can host open or closed, Fediverse services for your domain.
  
### Free Fediverse Accounts With Each Membership

* One social account at izzup.com *(username@izzup.com)*
* One personal professional account at ultri.com *(username@ultri.com)*
* Each Organization created receives a business account at ultri.com *(username@ultri.com)* and a social account *(username@izzup.com)*

### Hosted Fediverse Domains

We can host a Fediverse service using your domain, for as little as $10 per month. *(username@{your-domain}) or (username@fedi.{your-domain})*

You control the rules and moderation within your Fediverse, we only provide the hosting. We can cover moderation services in some cases, reach out if you are interested.

* The hostname for the member account: *username@{your-domain}*
* The hostname for the Fediverse API services. examples: [fedi.izzup.com](https://fedi.izzup.com) and [members.ultri.com](https://members.ultri.com).
* The hostname for the web client. examples: [fedi.ultri.com](https://fedi.ultri.com) and [what.izzup.com](https://what.izzup.com)
* The appearance of the web client. We offer development services to customize versions of the web client. AGPL licensing requires that those derivatives be shared, here is [ours](https://github.com/Ultri-Izzup/antlers). 

### Ultri + Izzup - The Fediverse on Steroids

We provide Fediverse services using [GoToSocial](https://docs.gotosocial.org/en/latest/) on the backend and [Elk](https://github.com/elk-zone/elk) on the front end. 

We also support a suite of publishing tools through Ultri, that can be integrated with your social or professional Fediverse accounts. You can configure centralized alerts or keep things siloed, it is all up to you.

### Governance of Fediverse Communities

Both Ultri and Izzup will be governed by the users, not by us. Ultri will use the same consensus decision-making tools we are creating for businesses, to hand over governance of the respective Fediverse communities to their members. All federation activity, content rules and activities rules will be subject to their control. **You** will have a voice in what is or is not allowed.

Business Fediverse hosting accounts can set their own rules. They can define them up front, or use the Ultri governance tools to simplify the process and create a better community.
