### Mission Satement

We make software to help good people do great things.

#### Our Path

We address the rising cost and lack of control prevalent in current solutions on the Internet by making the users and developers the owners. The co-op members own the software with no expensive marketing departments or VC profiteers involved. Once we are running profitably this will result in signficantly lower prices.

For a low monthly price the co-op member gets metered access to a variety of software services. Most notably or Logbook product in with support sociocratic or alternative methodologies. The member doesn't need to worry about their software solution raising prices or being bought out by a megalomaniac. They know they are paying the lowest price possible, becasue the profits are shared back to them.

#### To Be Determined...

* The majority of the Bylaws will be fined tuned over the next month.  
* The bylaws will represent the concepts above, in greater detail.
* The most current version will be at https://coop.ultri.com/bylaws.
