            A Discord channel was created to discuss what a "tech co-op" was and
            how it could operate. We talked with other co-ops about how they
            operated and what they were looking for. We still use the Discord
            today and refer to those early notes, though things have changed a
            lot in that time.

              One early understanding was that open, portable systems were
              required. We spent a couple of months trialing various open source
              auth and web solutions, looking for the right balance of power and
              simplicity.

            Various co-op groups couldn't decide on a project to move fowards,
            we could even decide &quot;how to decide&quot;. This led to looking
            into using Sociocracy to improve the decsion making process. That
            proved to be just another problem, as there was no quick, easy way
            to know if you were using Sociocracy correctly.

            We decided to create the sociocracy tools we wished were there for

            <a href="https://www.opensociocracy.org">OpenSociocracy.org</a> to
            house those efforts. We created another Discord channel and reached
            out to the Sociocracy community for assistance in defining the open
            source tools.

            Since may of our tools aren't directly related to sociocracy, we
