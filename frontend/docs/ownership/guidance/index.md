# Ultri Co-op  Guidance

## Board of Directors

The board will consist of 3 developers and 3 end users. The possibility of a deadlock is intentional, neither side can be forced into accepting anything.

## Member Committees

Various permanent and temporary committees will be formed to guide internal projects.

## Outside Advisors

We rely on a pool of informal advisors with specialties in co-ops, startups, business , sociocracy and open source development.
