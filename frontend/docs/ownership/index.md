# Ultri Co-op Ownership Model

Our co-op seeks to provide stable, affordable software for end users, as well as meaningful jobs for developers. It does this by making the user and developers the owners, cutting out all the bureaucratic middlemen and VC profiteers usually involved.

We have a unique multi-stakeholder co-op, it is owned by both users and developers.

* The majority control sits with the software users, they can be assured they will get the product they want.
* The majority of financial benefit, goes to the hardworking developers.
