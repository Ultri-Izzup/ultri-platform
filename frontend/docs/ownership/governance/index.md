# Ultri Co-op Governance Rights

## Decisions

* All members vote equally. 
* A given human may vote as an end user, a developer and the member of multiple organizations if they qualify in each during the vote.
* Members must have been in good standing the previous 4 months to vote on an issue.
* We will use tools built by the co-op to manage the voting and decsion making processes.

## Operations

* Daily decisions are left up to the people tasked with doing the work.
* We'll have regularly scheduled meetings in Discord voice chat to discuss technical, marketing and operations issues. These will be open to all members. Not all members will be allowed to speak in all meetings, but they arte always welcome to listen in.
